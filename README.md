# STUDENTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (C++)

A modernized **C++ implementation** of a Student Management System, built with OOP principles and modular architecture.  
This is the continuation and extension of the [original C project](https://github.com/dimitristheodoropoulos/STUDENTS-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM).

---

## 📌 Features
- Add, view, edit, delete, and search students.  
- Save/load student data from files.  
- Sort students by name or grade.  
- Filter students by grade range.  
- Generate and display statistics.  
- Organized with classes and headers (`Student`, `StudentManager`, `FileHandler`, `StatsCalculator`).  
- Unit tests for core functionality.  
- Cross-platform (Linux/Windows).

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./student_management
